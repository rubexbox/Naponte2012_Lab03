Python project made for a class at FAU. Simple program designed to perform the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm and print a list of all primes between 2 and a user-defined number.
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)

For simplicity's sake, the program only works for numbers between 2 and 300. Entering a number higher or lower than this range will produce an error message.
